## Phase 5 — Analysis

### Q5.1 — Checkout Implementation

`pes checkout` must do two things: update the `.pes/` directory and restore the working tree to match the target branch's snapshot.

**`.pes/` directory changes:**
- `HEAD` is updated to `ref: refs/heads/<branchname>`
- If the branch is new, a file is created at `.pes/refs/heads/<branchname>` containing the current commit hash

**Working directory changes:**
- The target commit object is read to get its tree hash
- The tree is recursively walked; every blob is written to disk at its correct path
- Files present in the old branch but absent from the new one are deleted from disk

**Four complexities to handle simultaneously:**

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Dirty working directory | Detect and refuse if local modifications would be silently overwritten |
| Recursive tree traversal | Nested subdirectories must be correctly created and populated |
| Deletions | Files in the old tree but absent from the new one must be removed from disk |
| Atomicity | A failed mid-checkout leaves the working directory broken; minimise that window |

---

### Q5.2 — Detecting a Dirty Working Directory

For each file tracked in the current index, two checks are performed:

**Step 1 — Metadata check (fast path)**
`stat` the file on disk and compare `mtime` and `size` against the stored index entry. If either differs, the file has been modified since it was last staged. This avoids re-hashing every file on every operation.

**Step 2 — Hash comparison**
Read the target branch's commit, resolve its tree, and find the blob hash for the same file path. Compare that hash against the current index entry.

**Decision logic:**

```
file modified on disk  AND  hash differs between branches  →  REFUSE checkout
                                "Your local changes would be overwritten"

file unmodified on disk  AND  hash differs between branches  →  safe to overwrite
```

This two-step check using `mtime`, `size`, and hash allows conflict detection without reading every file's full contents.

---

### Q5.3 — Detached HEAD State

**What it means:**
`.pes/HEAD` contains a raw commit hash instead of a branch reference (e.g. `ref: refs/heads/main`). This occurs when you checkout a specific commit rather than a branch name.

**What happens if you commit in this state:**
Commits are created correctly with parent pointers, but no branch ref is updated to track them. The moment you checkout a different branch, HEAD moves away and those commits become unreachable — nothing in `.pes/refs/` points to them.

**Recovery:**

*If you haven't switched away yet:*
```bash
# Write current HEAD hash to a new branch ref
echo <current-commit-hash> > .pes/refs/heads/recovery-branch
```

*If you've already switched away:*
You need the lost commit hash. In real Git this is recoverable via the reflog at `.git/logs/HEAD`, which records every position HEAD has ever held. Without a reflog, you must find the hash in terminal history. Once found, create a branch file pointing to it to make the chain reachable again.

---

## Phase 6 — Garbage Collection

### Q6.1 — Finding and Deleting Unreachable Objects

The algorithm follows a classic **mark-and-sweep** approach in two phases.

**Mark phase**
Starting from all branch refs in `.pes/refs/heads/` and `HEAD`, each commit hash is added to a reachable set. Each commit's tree hash is also added, and the tree is recursively walked — every sub-tree and blob is added to the set. The commit's parent pointer is followed and the process repeats until a root commit (no parent) is reached.

**Sweep phase**
Every file under `.pes/objects/` is visited. The hash is reconstructed from the path (first two characters form the shard directory; the rest is the filename). If the hash is absent from the reachable set, the file is deleted.

**Data structure:**
A hash table keyed on the 32-byte `ObjectID` is best, giving O(1) insertion and lookup. A sorted array with binary search is a simpler alternative at O(log n) per lookup.

**Scale estimate for 100,000 commits across 50 branches:**

Assuming ~25 objects per commit (1 commit object, 1 root tree, several sub-trees, ~15–20 blobs):

```
100,000 commits × 25 objects ≈ 2.5 million objects in the mark phase
Sweep phase reads the full .pes/objects/ directory listing (~same size)
Total: roughly 2–5 million file operations
```

---

### Q6.2 — GC Race Condition

**The problem:**
During commit creation, new objects are written to the object store *before* they are referenced by any branch or tag. This creates a window where they appear unreachable to an outside observer.

**The race:**

```
Thread A (commit)                  Thread B (GC)
─────────────────                  ─────────────
write blob objects          →      [blobs now on disk, unreferenced]
                                   mark phase: scans all refs
                                   does NOT see new blobs
                                   sweep phase: deletes blobs ← CORRUPTION
write tree + commit object  →      references now-deleted blobs
```

The repository is corrupt: the commit object points to blobs that no longer exist.

**How Git avoids it:**
- **Grace period**: Any loose object newer than a configurable threshold (default: 2 weeks) is never deleted by GC, regardless of whether it appears reachable. This gives any in-progress operation ample time to complete and establish references.
- **Lock file**: Git writes `.git/gc.pid` to prevent multiple GC processes from running simultaneously.
- **Age-gating**: GC only collects loose objects that have existed long enough that no concurrent operation could still be mid-way through referencing them.

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Content-addressable storage | Objects stored and retrieved by SHA hash |
| Tree-based snapshots | Directory structure encoded as tree objects |
| Commit history | Linked list of commits via parent pointers |

This project demonstrates how Git works internally, using only filesystem primitives — no external VCS libraries.


# Building PES-VCS — A Version Control System from Scratch

**Objective:** Build a local version control system that tracks file changes, stores snapshots efficiently, and supports commit history. Every component maps directly to operating system and filesystem concepts.

**Platform:** Ubuntu 22.04

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gcc build-essential libssl-dev
```

### Using This Repository

This is a **template repository**. Do **not** fork it.

1. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"** on GitHub
2. Name your repository (e.g., `SRN-pes-vcs`) and set it to **public**. Replace `SRN` with your actual SRN, e.g., `PESXUG24CSYYY-pes-vcs`
3. Clone this repository to your local machine and do all your lab work inside this directory.
4.  **Important:** Remember to commit frequently as you progress. You are required to have a minimum of 5 detailed commits per phase. Refer to [Submission Requirements](#submission-requirements) for more details.
5. Clone your new repository and start working

The repository contains skeleton source files with `// TODO` markers where you need to write code. Functions marked `// PROVIDED` are complete — do not modify them.

### Building

```bash
make          # Build the pes binary
make all      # Build pes + test binaries
make clean    # Remove all build artifacts
```

### Author Configuration

PES-VCS reads the author name from the `PES_AUTHOR` environment variable:

```bash
export PES_AUTHOR="Your Name <PESXUG24CS042>"
```

If unset, it defaults to `"PES User <pes@localhost>"`.

## Understanding Git: What You're Building

Before writing code, understand how Git works under the hood. Git is a content-addressable filesystem with a few clever data structures on top. Everything in this lab is based on Git's real design.

### The Big Picture

When you run `git commit`, Git doesn't store "changes" or "diffs." It stores **complete snapshots** of your entire project. Git uses two tricks to make this efficient:

1. **Content-addressable storage:** Every file is stored by the SHA hash of its contents. Same content = same hash = stored only once.
2. **Tree structures:** Directories are stored as "tree" objects that point to file contents, so unchanged files are just pointers to existing data.

```
Your project at commit A:          Your project at commit B:
                                   (only README changed)

    root/                              root/
    ├── README.md  ─────┐              ├── README.md  ─────┐
    ├── src/            │              ├── src/            │
    │   └── main.c ─────┼─┐            │   └── main.c ─────┼─┐
    └── Makefile ───────┼─┼─┐          └── Makefile ───────┼─┼─┐

                        ▼ ▼ ▼                              ▼ ▼ ▼
    Object Store:       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                        │  a1b2c3 (README v1)    ← only this is new   │
                        │  d4e5f6 (README v2)                         │
                        │  789abc (main.c)       ← shared by both!    │
                        │  fedcba (Makefile)     ← shared by both!    │
                        └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Three Object Types

#### 1. Blob (Binary Large Object)

A blob is just file contents. No filename, no permissions — just the raw bytes.

```
blob 16\0Hello, World!\n
     ↑    ↑
     │    └── The actual file content
     └─────── Size in bytes
```

The blob is stored at a path determined by its SHA-256 hash. If two files have identical contents, they share one blob.

#### 2. Tree

A tree represents a directory. It's a list of entries, each pointing to a blob (file) or another tree (subdirectory).

```
100644 blob a1b2c3d4... README.md
100755 blob e5f6a7b8... build.sh        ← executable file
040000 tree 9c0d1e2f... src             ← subdirectory
       ↑    ↑           ↑
       │    │           └── name
       │    └── hash of the object
       └─────── mode (permissions + type)
```

Mode values:
- `100644` — regular file, not executable
- `100755` — regular file, executable
- `040000` — directory (tree)

#### 3. Commit

A commit ties everything together. It points to a tree (the project snapshot) and contains metadata.

```
tree 9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d
parent a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0
author Alice <alice@example.com> 1699900000
committer Alice <alice@example.com> 1699900000

Add new feature
```

The parent pointer creates a linked list of history:

```
    C3 ──────► C2 ──────► C1 ──────► (no parent)
    │          │          │
    ▼          ▼          ▼
  Tree3      Tree2      Tree1
```

### How Objects Connect

```

                    │           COMMIT                │

       └────────┘
```

### References and HEAD

References are files that map human-readable names to commit hashes:

```
.pes/
├── HEAD                    # "ref: refs/heads/main"
└── refs/
    └── heads/
        └── main            # Contains: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

**HEAD** points to a branch name. The branch file contains the latest commit hash. When you commit:

1. Git creates the new commit object (pointing to parent)
2. Updates the branch file to contain the new commit's hash
3. HEAD still points to the branch, so it "follows" automatically

```
Before commit:                    After commit:

HEAD ─► main ─► C2 ─► C1         HEAD ─► main ─► C3 ─► C2 ─► C1
```

### The Index (Staging Area)

The index is the "preparation area" for the next commit. It tracks which files are staged.

```
Working Directory          Index               Repository (HEAD)
─────────────────         ─────────           ─────────────────
README.md (modified) ──── pes add ──► README.md (staged)
src/main.c                            src/main.c          ──► Last commit's
Makefile                               Makefile                snapshot
```

The workflow:

1. `pes add file.txt` → computes blob hash, stores blob, updates index
2. `pes commit -m "msg"` → builds tree from index, creates commit, updates branch ref

### Content-Addressable Storage

Objects are named by their content's hash:

```python
# Pseudocode
def store_object(content):
    hash = sha256(content)
    path = f".pes/objects/{hash[0:2]}/{hash[2:]}"
    write_file(path, content)
    return hash
```

This gives us:
- **Deduplication:** Identical files stored once
- **Integrity:** Hash verifies data isn't corrupted
- **Immutability:** Changing content = different hash = different object

Objects are sharded by the first two hex characters to avoid huge directories:

```
.pes/objects/
├── 2f/
│   └── 8a3b5c7d9e...
├── a1/
│   ├── 9c4e6f8a0b...
│   └── b2d4f6a8c0...
└── ff/
    └── 1234567890...
```

### Exploring a Real Git Repository

You can inspect Git's internals yourself:

```bash
mkdir test-repo && cd test-repo && git init
echo "Hello" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt && git commit -m "First commit"

find .git/objects -type f          # See stored objects
git cat-file -t <hash>            # Show type: blob, tree, or commit
git cat-file -p <hash>            # Show contents
cat .git/HEAD                     # See what HEAD points to
cat .git/refs/heads/main          # See branch pointer
```

---

## What You'll Build

PES-VCS implements five commands across four phases:

```
pes init              Create .pes/ repository structure
pes add <file>...     Stage files (hash + update index)
pes status            Show modified/staged/untracked files
pes commit -m <msg>   Create commit from staged files
pes log               Walk and display commit history
```

The `.pes/` directory structure:

```
my_project/
├── .pes/
│   ├── objects/          # Content-addressable blob/tree/commit storage
│   │   ├── 2f/
│   │   │   └── 8a3b...   # Sharded by first 2 hex chars of hash
│   │   └── a1/
│   │       └── 9c4e...
│   ├── refs/
│   │   └── heads/
│   │       └── main      # Branch pointer (file containing commit hash)
│   ├── index             # Staging area (text file)
│   └── HEAD              # Current branch reference
└── (working directory files)
```

## Phase 1: Object Storage Foundation

**Filesystem Concepts:** Content-addressable storage, directory sharding, atomic writes, hashing for integrity

**Files:** `pes.h` (read), `object.c` (implement `object_write` and `object_read`)

### What to Implement

Open `object.c`. Two functions are marked `// TODO`:

1. **`object_write`** — Stores data in the object store.
   - Prepends a type header (`"blob <size>\0"`, `"tree <size>\0"`, or `"commit <size>\0"`)
   - Computes SHA-256 of the full object (header + data)
   - Writes atomically using the temp-file-then-rename pattern
   - Shards into subdirectories by first 2 hex chars of hash

2. **`object_read`** — Retrieves and verifies data from the object store.
   - Reads the file, parses the header to extract type and size
   - **Verifies integrity** by recomputing the hash and comparing to the filename
   - Returns the data portion (after the `\0`)

Read the detailed step-by-step comments in `object.c` before starting.

### Testing

```bash
make test_objects
./test_objects
```

The test program verifies:
- Blob storage and retrieval (write, read back, compare)
- Deduplication (same content → same hash → stored once)
- Integrity checking (detects corrupted objects)

**📸 Screenshot 1A:** Output of `./test_objects` showing all tests passing.

**📸 Screenshot 1B:** `find .pes/objects -type f` showing the sharded directory structure.

## Phase 2: Tree Objects

**Filesystem Concepts:** Directory representation, recursive structures, file modes and permissions

**Files:** `tree.h` (read), `tree.c` (implement all TODO functions)

### What to Implement

Open `tree.c`. Implement the function marked `// TODO`:

1. **`tree_from_index`** — Builds a tree hierarchy from the index.
   - Handles nested paths: `"src/main.c"` must create a `src` subtree
   - This is what `pes commit` uses to create the snapshot
   - Writes all tree objects to the object store and returns the root hash

### Testing

```bash
make test_tree
./test_tree
```

The test program verifies:
- Serialize → parse roundtrip preserves entries, modes, and hashes
- Deterministic serialization (same entries in any order → identical output)

**📸 Screenshot 2A:** Output of `./test_tree` showing all tests passing.

**📸 Screenshot 2B:** Pick a tree object from `find .pes/objects -type f` and run `xxd .pes/objects/XX/YYY... | head -20` to show the raw binary format.

---

## Phase 3: The Index (Staging Area)

**Filesystem Concepts:** File format design, atomic writes, change detection using metadata

**Files:** `index.h` (read), `index.c` (implement all TODO functions)

### What to Implement

Open `index.c`. Three functions are marked `// TODO`:

1. **`index_load`** — Reads the text-based `.pes/index` file into an `Index` struct.
   - If the file doesn't exist, initializes an empty index (this is not an error)
   - Parses each line: `<mode> <hash-hex> <mtime> <size> <path>`

2. **`index_save`** — Writes the index atomically (temp file + rename).
   - Sorts entries by path before writing
   - Uses `fsync()` on the temp file before renaming

3. **`index_add`** — Stages a file: reads it, writes blob to object store, updates index entry.
   - Use the provided `index_find` to check for an existing entry

`index_find` , `index_status` and `index_remove` are already implemented for you — read them to understand the index data structure before starting.

#### Expected Output of `pes status`

```
Staged changes:
  staged:     hello.txt
  staged:     src/main.c

Unstaged changes:
  modified:   README.md
  deleted:    old_file.txt

Untracked files:
  untracked:  notes.txt
```

If a section has no entries, print the header followed by `(nothing to show)`.

### Testing

```bash
make pes
./pes init
echo "hello" > file1.txt
echo "world" > file2.txt
./pes add file1.txt file2.txt
./pes status
cat .pes/index    # Human-readable text format
```

**📸 Screenshot 3A:** Run `./pes init`, `./pes add file1.txt file2.txt`, `./pes status` — show the output.

**📸 Screenshot 3B:** `cat .pes/index` showing the text-format index with your entries.

## Phase 4: Commits and History

**Filesystem Concepts:** Linked structures on disk, reference files, atomic pointer updates

**Files:** `commit.h` (read), `commit.c` (implement all TODO functions)

### What to Implement

Open `commit.c`. One function is marked `// TODO`:

1. **`commit_create`** — The main commit function:
   - Builds a tree from the index using `tree_from_index()` (**not** from the working directory — commits snapshot the staged state)
   - Reads current HEAD as the parent (may not exist for first commit)
   - Gets the author string from `pes_author()` (defined in `pes.h`)
   - Writes the commit object, then updates HEAD

`commit_parse`, `commit_serialize`, `commit_walk`, `head_read`, and `head_update` are already implemented — read them to understand the commit format before writing `commit_create`.

The commit text format is specified in the comment at the top of `commit.c`.

### Testing

```bash
./pes init
echo "Hello" > hello.txt
./pes add hello.txt
./pes commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "World" >> hello.txt
./pes add hello.txt
./pes commit -m "Add world"

echo "Goodbye" > bye.txt
./pes add bye.txt
./pes commit -m "Add farewell"

./pes log
```

You can also run the full integration test:

```bash
make test-integration
```

**📸 Screenshot 4A:** Output of `./pes log` showing three commits with hashes, authors, timestamps, and messages.

**📸 Screenshot 4B:** `find .pes -type f | sort` showing object store growth after three commits.

**📸 Screenshot 4C:** `cat .pes/refs/heads/main` and `cat .pes/HEAD` showing the reference chain.

## Phase 5 & 6: Analysis-Only Questions

The following questions cover filesystem concepts beyond the implementation scope of this lab. Answer them in writing — no code required.

### Branching and Checkout

**Q5.1:** A branch in Git is just a file in `.git/refs/heads/` containing a commit hash. Creating a branch is creating a file. Given this, how would you implement `pes checkout <branch>` — what files need to change in `.pes/`, and what must happen to the working directory? What makes this operation complex?

**Q5.2:** When switching branches, the working directory must be updated to match the target branch's tree. If the user has uncommitted changes to a tracked file, and that file differs between branches, checkout must refuse. Describe how you would detect this "dirty working directory" conflict using only the index and the object store.

**Q5.3:** "Detached HEAD" means HEAD contains a commit hash directly instead of a branch reference. What happens if you make commits in this state? How could a user recover those commits?

### Garbage Collection and Space Reclamation

**Q6.1:** Over time, the object store accumulates unreachable objects — blobs, trees, or commits that no branch points to (directly or transitively). Describe an algorithm to find and delete these objects. What data structure would you use to track "reachable" hashes efficiently? For a repository with 100,000 commits and 50 branches, estimate how many objects you'd need to visit.

**Q6.2:** Why is it dangerous to run garbage collection concurrently with a commit operation? Describe a race condition where GC could delete an object that a concurrent commit is about to reference. How does Git's real GC avoid this?

## Submission Requirements

**1. GitHub Repository**
* You must submit the link to your GitHub repository via the official submission link (which will be shared by your respective faculty).
* The repository must strictly maintain the directory structure you built throughout this lab.
* Ensure your github repository is made `public`

**2. Lab Report**
* Your report, containing all required **screenshots** and answers to the **analysis questions**, must be placed at the **root** of your repository directory.
* The report must be submitted as either a PDF (`report.pdf`) or a Markdown file (`README.md`).

**3. Commit History (Graded Requirement)**
